# üöÄ Lead Scraper Pro: AI-Powered Lead Generation Tool

## ‚ú® Project Overview

Lead Scraper Pro is a powerful, open-source Streamlit application designed to automate the process of lead generation. It uses a combination of intelligent AI agents, web scraping, and API integrations to find and extract valuable contact and company information.

This tool is built to solve the common problem of manually searching for leads across multiple platforms, saving you significant time and effort. It provides two core functionalities:

1.  **üë§ Lead Contacts Scraper:** Find emails, phone numbers, names, and company details for individuals across popular professional and social platforms like LinkedIn, GitHub, and more.
2.  **üí∞ Company Funding Scraper:** Discover recently funded companies in a specific industry and enrich their profiles with detailed information from sources like Apollo.io.

The application is built with a focus on simplicity, featuring a user-friendly interface powered by Streamlit that makes the complex process of web scraping accessible to everyone.

## üõ†Ô∏è Features

* **AI-Powered Search:** Uses an AI agent to intelligently formulate search queries and find relevant URLs from various social and professional networks.
* **Multi-Platform Scraping:** Scrapes data from multiple websites including `linkedin.com`, `github.com`, `facebook.com`, and `twitter.com` for individual leads.
* **Targeted Funding Search:** Scrapes recent funding news from sites like `crunchbase.com`, `techcrunch.com`, and `venturebeat.com`.
* **Intelligent Data Extraction:** Extracts emails, phone numbers, names, and company details from unstructured website content.
* **Apollo.io Integration:** (Optional) Enriches company funding data with comprehensive details such as CEO name, company phone, employee count, and revenue using the Apollo.io API.
* **Data Persistence:** Uses `st.session_state` to prevent the app from restarting and losing data on every user interaction.
* **Downloadable Results:** Export your scraped leads and company data directly as a CSV file.
